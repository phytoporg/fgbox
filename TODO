- ditch steamcmd, it's not great for launching games
- need extra step to configure proton:
-- ~/.local/share/Steam/config/config.vdf
    InstallConfigStore.Software.Valve.Steam.CompatToolMapping.<APPID> = 
    {
        "name" "proton_experimental"
        "config" ""
        "priority" "250"
    }
- comment files for other humans (once stuff actually works)
- create initial README pass
