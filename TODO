- config step needs PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 (system settings?)
- patch_vdf needs an "--add-missing-paths" option or something similar
- need extra step to configure proton:
-- ~/.local/share/Steam/config/config.vdf
    InstallConfigStore.Software.Valve.Steam.CompatToolMapping.<APPID> = 
    {
        "name" "proton_experimental"
        "config" ""
        "priority" "250"
    }
- comment files for other humans (once stuff actually works)
- create initial README pass
